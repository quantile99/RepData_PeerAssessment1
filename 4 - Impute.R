# Imputing missing values #
###########################
# Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing values 
# (coded as NA). The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some 
# calculations or summaries of the data.

# 1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset 
# (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)

# 2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset.
# The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the
# mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

# 3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the 
# missing data filled in.

# 4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate
# and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these 
# values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What 
# is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily 
# number of steps?
